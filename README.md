# Perceptual decision making in the basal ganglia

This repository contains code for my bachelor project on a cortico-basal
ganglia-thalamic model for perceptual decision making, with a focus on possible
implementation in neuromorphic hardware.

The model is implemented in Python using Nengo and simulates a two-alternative
perceptual decision-making task inspired by random dot motion experiments.

## Academic context

This repository accompanies a bachelor project on basal-ganglia-inspired
perceptual decision making and neuromorphic hardware.

If reusing the code or ideas, please cite the associated thesis or contact the
author.

## Project overview

The project investigates the performance a basal ganglia-inspired action selection
circuit perceptual decision making under ambiguous sensory input. Furthermore,
it investigates whether a cortex-inspired pre-processing unit can improve performance,
and how global modulation of excitability through learning could affect the decision-making
process

The model consists of:

- a cortex-inspired preprocessing module
- a basal ganglia action-selection circuit
- a thalamic output stage
- simulation tools for testing accuracy, reaction time, and decision stability.

The task uses left/right stimulus inputs with varying strength, coherence, and
noise.

Furthermore, this repository contains the data and figures generated for the thesis.

## Usage
Download dependencies from requirements.txt and pyproject.toml. If pyproject.toml is not
incorporated correctly, the system will not be able to find the source files. The dependencies 
can be installed like this.
```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you are using visual studio code, I recommend creating a virtual envelope and specifying that
dependencies should be installed from the two mentioned files.

Look to the scripts folder if you want to reproduce data from the thesis. Look to the notebooks
if you want to reproduce the figures.
You can also run your own experiments. Study the networks carefully along with the simulation builder.

>[!CAUTION]
>The generated figures depend upon a working Tex installation, such as MikTex of TeX Live.
>The notebooks will not run if you do not have Tex installed. Alternatively, remove the line 
>`use_latex_fonts()` in the beginning of each notebook. I cannot guarantee that the plots
>will look pretty, however.
>Also, if you wish to reproduce data by using the given scripts, be aware that data generation
>will take a long time. Each script can take a few hours to complete. Alternatively, the amount
>of neurons per ensemble can be reduced.
